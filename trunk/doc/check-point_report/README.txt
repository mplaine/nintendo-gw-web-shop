The project has started really well and is in the schedule. Each group member has completed, or partly completed, his task in schedule. The tasks and their status so far are as follows:
 * Setup version control [DONE, Markku]
 * Setup project template [DONE, Markku]
 * Implement URL patterns [PARTLY DONE, Kalle]
 * Implement models [DONE, Juha]
 * Implement RESTful API views [TODO, we might not need these after all]
 * Content: product details [DONE, Markku]
 * Graphics: layout and product images [PARTLY DONE, Markku and Kalle]
 * Implement dummy views and templates [PARTLY DONE, Kalle]
 * HTML & CSS [PARTLY DONE, Kalle]

We are still planning to complete the project with minor changes according to the project plan. Currently, the application allows the user to select a series (of products), do dummy searches on products and see the results as well as view dummy product pages.
